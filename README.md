# speech-generation-webui

A quick UI for Bark built on Gradio.

## Installation

This assumes you have CUDA installed

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
python app.py
```

This will download all the required models for Bark and Denoiser. So will take a while on the first run. After, just use the URL provided by Gradio in your browser.
